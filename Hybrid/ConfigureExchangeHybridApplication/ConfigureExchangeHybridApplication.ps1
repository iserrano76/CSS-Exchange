.SYNOPSIS
    This script can be used to configure the dedicated Exchange hybrid application.
    More information can be found in https://aka.ms/ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication
.DESCRIPTION
    This script configures and enables the dedicated Exchange hybrid application feature.
    It supports both All-in-one Configuration and Split Execution Configuration modes.
    Additionally, the script can reset the keyCredentials of the first-party service principal object or renew the Auth Certificate,
    which must be uploaded to the service principal of the newly created application.The script utilizes native Graph API calls to perform the configuration in Entra ID,
    acquiring an access token for the Graph API using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).
.PARAMETER FullyConfigureExchangeHybridApplication
    Use this switch parameter fully configure the dedicated Exchange hybrid application feature.
.PARAMETER CreateApplication
    Use this switch parameter to create the application in Microsoft Entra ID.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
.PARAMETER DeleteApplication
    Use this switch parameter to delete an existing application in Microsoft Entra ID. Note that the script will only delete the application.
    The script doesn't undo any changes, e.g. to Auth Server objects and doesn't remove the Setting Override.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
.PARAMETER UpdateCertificate
    Use this switch parameter to upload the Auth Certificate to the application in Microsoft Entra ID.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
.PARAMETER ConfigureAuthServer
    Use this switch parameter to configure the Auth Server object. The script will add the appId of the newly created application to the "EvoSTS" or
    "EvoSTS - {Guid}" Auth Server object.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
.PARAMETER CustomAppId
    Use this parameter to provide the Application (client) ID (also known as appId) of a custom application in Microsoft Entra ID.
    In most cases this parameter does not need to be used.
.PARAMETER TenantId
    Use this parameter to provide the ID of your tenant in Microsoft Entra ID.
    In most cases this parameter does not need to be used.
.PARAMETER RemoteRoutingDomain
    Use this parameter to provide the remote routing domain of your tenant in Microsoft Entra ID.
    In most cases this parameter does not need to be used.
.PARAMETER ConfigureTargetSharingEpr
    Use this switch parameter to configure the Organization Relationship between Exchange Server and Exchange Online.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
.PARAMETER EnableExchangeHybridApplicationOverride
    Use this switch parameter to create the Setting Override which enables the dedicated Exchange hybrid application feature.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
.PARAMETER ResetFirstPartyServicePrincipalKeyCredentials
    Use this switch parameter to remove a specific or all available Key Credentials from the Service Principal of the "Office 365 Exchange Online" application
    By default, all existing Key Credentials will be removed. If you provide the thumbprint of a certificate by using the "CertificateInformation" parameter,
    only the specified and all expired certificates will be removed.
.PARAMETER AzureEnvironment
    Use this parameter to run the script against non-Global cloud environments, for example, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
    Values that can be used with this parameter are: Global, USGovernmentL4, USGovernmentL5, ChinaCloud
    The default value is: Global
.PARAMETER CustomGraphApiUri
    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use. Do not use it unless explicitly advised by Microsoft.
.PARAMETER CustomEntraAuthUri
    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use. Do not use it unless explicitly advised by Microsoft.
.PARAMETER CustomInitialCloudDomains
    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use. Do not use it unless explicitly advised by Microsoft.
.PARAMETER CustomMicrosoftDomains
    This parameter is reserved for internal Microsoft use. Do not use it unless explicitly advised by Microsoft.
.PARAMETER CertificateMethod
    Use this parameter to specify the method which should be used by the script to search for the Auth Certificate. By default, the script will
    try to export the current, and if already set, the new next Auth Certificate and will upload them to the application in Microsoft Entra ID.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
    Values that can be used with this parameter are: Thumbprint, File, Automated
    The default value is: Automated
.PARAMETER CertificateInformation
    Use this parameter to provide the thumbprint of the certificate that you want the script to export and upload or the file path to the
    certificate file, for example, "c:\temp\certificate.cer". You don't need to use this parameter if CertificateMethod is set to "Automated".
    If you provide the thumbprint, the script searches and exports the certificate with the thumbprint provided from the local machines certificate
    store. If you provide the file path, the script uploads the certificate, which was specified.
    This parameter allows you to run granular configurations. Note that some of the tasks depend on others and can't be run alone.
.PARAMETER ScriptUpdateOnly
    This optional parameter allows you to only update the script without performing any other actions.
.PARAMETER SkipVersionCheck
    This optional parameter allows you to skip the automatic version check and script update.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -FullyConfigureExchangeHybridApplication
    It will create the application in Microsoft Entra ID, upload the current and, if configured, the new next Auth Certificate, configure the Auth Server object,
    and create a global Setting Override to enable the feature.
    The script will also validate if the Auth Certificates are available as keyCredentials of the "Office 365 Exchange Online" first-party applications Service Principal and tries to remove them.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -UpdateCertificate
    It will upload the current and, if configured, the new next Auth Certificate to the application in Microsoft Entra ID. You can use this syntax if the Auth Certificate has been renewed.
    The script will also validate if the certificates are available as keyCredentials of the "Office 365 Exchange Online" first-party applications Service Principal and tries to remove them.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -ConfigureTargetSharingEpr
    It will update all enabled Organization Relationship objects that have the TargetAutodiscoverEpr set but not the TargetSharingEpr,
    and where DomainNames contain domains related to organizations hosted in Exchange Online.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -ResetFirstPartyServicePrincipalKeyCredentials
    It will delete all certificates of the "Office 365 Exchange Online" first-party applications Service Principal.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -ResetFirstPartyServicePrincipalKeyCredentials -CertificateInformation "1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678"
    It will remove the certificate with thumbprint 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 of the "Office 365 Exchange Online" first-party applications Service Principal.
    It will also remove all certificates that have already expired.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -DeleteApplication
    It will delete the application in Microsoft Entra ID. It doesn't undo any changes, such as to Auth Server objects, and it doesn't remove the Setting Override.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -CreateApplication -UpdateCertificate -CertificateMethod "File" -CertificateInformation "c:\temp\certificate.cer"
    It will create the application in Microsoft Entra ID and upload the certificate provided to the newly created application.
    The script will also validate if the certificates are available as keyCredentials of the "Office 365 Exchange Online" first-party application's Service Principal and tries to remove them.
    You can use this syntax if your Exchange Server doesn't provide outbound connectivity to Microsoft Graph API and you want to run the script on a machine with Microsoft Graph API connectivity.
    You need to export the Auth Certificate first (make sure NOT TO export the private key) and copy it over to the machine where the script is executed.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\> .\ConfigureExchangeHybridApplication.ps1 -ConfigureAuthServer -EnableExchangeHybridApplicationOverride -CustomAppId <appId> -TenantId <tenantId> -RemoteRoutingDomain <targetDeliveryDomain>
    It will configure the Auth Server object and enable the dedicated Exchange hybrid application feature. The script will not try to create the application in Microsoft Entra ID and will not try to upload the Auth Certificate.
    It uses of the App ID which is provided. The script will not verify if the App ID is correct as it will not perform any Graph API calls.
    You can use this syntax if the application was already created by using a different non-Exchange Server machine as described in the previous example.
    It's intended for environments where Exchange Server has no outgoing connection to Microsoft Graph API.
